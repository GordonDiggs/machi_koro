# Machi Koro

Machi Koro is a game (published by Pandasaurus) based around rolling dice, earning money and purchasing cards with that money. It's fairly simple, which makes it a good coding project for a newbie Ruby programmer like myself.

This gem is intended to fully model the game. It is up to you to create a front end for it (or a view & controller if we're talking MVC, which is generally A Good Thing). However I will create a command line interface that will show off all the functionality, and let you play a game entirely via an interactive console.
